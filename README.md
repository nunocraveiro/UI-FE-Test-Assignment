# Running the app

Run both the 'npm install' and 'npm start' commands to start the app at localhost:3000.

## Features

The app starts at a login screen for a fictional employee at Ubiquiti and has no authentication functionality.
The login button redirects the user to the '/devices' page.

For viewing all the devices, the app features both a list and grid view. 
For looking up any specific results, the search feature and the filter are also fully functional.

Upon clicking any of the products the user is redirected to that specific product page which features its name, some details and an image.

The app is also responsive for mobile and desktop.

## Future work

Some features that were not implemented but would improve this app:
- compare products feature to be able to see devices and their characteristics side by side 
- pagination (optional and depending on usability case)
- error messages, namely messages for when the filter or the search do not return any results
- a button to clear all selected filters
- unit testing
- deploying
